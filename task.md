Real-Time Voice AI Orchestration
Goal
Build an end-to-end real-time voice agent where a user can talk to the agent over WebRTC
(via LiveKit) and the agent can answer using prompt instructions and RAG over uploaded
documents during the call.
Core Requirements
A) Voice Orchestration (LiveKit)
● Use LiveKit to enable real-time voice conversation over WebRTC.
● Orchestrate the pipeline as separate components:
1. STT service/component
2. LLM service/component
3. TTS service/component
4. Knowledge Base (KB) ingestion + retrieval component
B) Knowledge Base + RAG
● Frontend should allow uploading documents to create a KB
● Implement ingestion:
○ chunking + embeddings + storage in a vector store (your choice)
● During the live call, the agent must:
○ retrieve relevant context from the uploaded KB
○ use it in the LLM response
○ speak the response back via TTS
● In the demo, you must show a query that is clearly answered using the uploaded
documents.
C) Frontend (React preferred)
Build a UI with these 3 capabilities:
1. Talk to the agent over WebRTC (LiveKit room connect, start/stop, mic controls)
2. Tweak the agent prompt (system prompt editable in UI)
3. Upload documents for KB creation (basic KB management is fine)
Optional but helpful:
● live transcript view (partial/final)
● “RAG sources used” panel (show retrieved chunks or doc titles)
Deliverables (Submission)
Please submit all of the following:
1. Demo video link (Google Drive)
○ A short video showing:
■ prompt tweak
■ document upload
■ start call
■ ask a question that triggers RAG from uploaded docs
■ agent answers via voice
○ No code walkthrough/discussion needed in the video.
2. Codebase
○ Either a GitHub repo link (preferred) OR a zip file
○ Include a clear README with:
■ setup steps
■ environment variables
■ how to run frontend + backend
■ how to run LiveKit (local or cloud)
■ any known limitations/tradeoffs
Evaluation Criteria
We’ll review on:
● End-to-end correctness: voice call works; RAG works during call
● Code quality: separation of concerns, readability, structure
● Product thinking: UI clarity, usability, basic error handling
● Operational maturity (bonus): Dockerization, simple deployability, logs/metrics hooks
